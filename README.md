## Thoughts/Questions:

*   Chapter focuses heavily on framework specific implementation. Zooming out, what are some of the broader takeaways and learnings the author wants us to grok?
*   How do we translate the advice and techniques in this chapter to our own stack?
*   Any differences in how you understood integration tests vs how they are described in the book?
*   How does Rails affect how we think about unit tests vs integration tests compared to other frameworks...? 
*   What differentiates an integration test vs a component test?
*   What techniques and testing strategies should we adopt
*   Where are we lacking in the "testing pyramid"? Are we too heavy in one area vs another?
*   How would we do contract based testing? What tooling is there? How do you share contracts between disparate consumers / providers (across repos & languages)? Duplicate stubs & common tooling?
*   What would end to end testing look like for Learn?
